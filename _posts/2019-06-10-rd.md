# Summary

For the latter half of 2019 and January 2020, I managed an initiative at Clark Construction to
improve daily manpower reporting on construction sites. The focus of the team was to create an
app that allows subcontractors to:
1. Enter how many people were working that day
2. Describe which activities were worked on that day
3. Link the performed work with project schedule activities

# Project Context and Goals

The goal of the Manpower App project was to develop an easy system to track the following:
1. The number of people on site each day
2. The productivity of each crew
3. The progress of each schedule activity
4. The timeliness and accuracy of daily reports
5. The percent of daily reports reviewed and verified by construction management team

Tracking manpower and progress on schedule takes a significant amount of a construction manager's time. Typically this is done by manual surveys or estimates. Having an automated way to track progress can lead to more efficient review of contractor performance and billing, as well as a better way to document progress for monthly reports. Our team estimated that the proposed manpower app could lead to a 50% decrease in time spent progress tracking.

This project also made headway on subcontractor daily report compliance. Each contractor must complete a daily report each work day listing out what work was completed and how many people were on the project that day. In the past, this was all done on paper and paperwork could easily be lost or misplaced. With the new digital system, the team would be able to easily see all reports without fear of losing them. Keeping these records is vital, especially in case of an audit or lawsuit. If a trade contractor or other party has a dispute about the project work, teams use daily reports to piece together what was actually occurring each day.

To this end, it is important for project teams to actually read daily reports. If a contractor is falsifying information to build up a claim for a future lawsuit, the team needs to catch this and make sure only accurate information is written and saved. As such, another key goal of this project was to create a module to allow the construction management team to review and approve/reject daily reports. This module allowed a team to see which reports were submitted, which required approval, and which had been rejected.

With these goals in mind, our team led app development and beta testing to turn the above goals into a company wide standard reporting system. We hoped that the new method would yield higher daily report compliance and review, which in turn would lead to decreased time spent manually entering report information and increased assurance that project records were safely stored for auditing and legal purposes.

# Work Performed

## Product Management Role

In tandem with a co-worker, I created the frameworks for the visuals and reporting features in
the application.

The application had several main components:
- Home Dashboard
- Daily report input module
- Daily report review summary module
- Daily report review detail module

The app was developed by a web development contractor, using pug.js language. My colleague and I oversaw the developer by leading weekly demo sessions, creating and updating a product backlog, and testing the weekly product for accuracy. Testing was done by our R&D team in conjunction with a pilot project. I also helped oversee budgeting, invoicing, and development of a Phase II product backlog/scope for the project.

Below, I will provide an overview of the work done on each of the app components.

### Home Dashboard

On the home page of the web app, there are links to the other app modules and a snippet of the day's schedule. 

Additionally, five app KPIs are displayed for the construction team to view. These KPIs measure daily report and review timeliness, and I created them by querying the app database via mySQL and SQL Server Management Studio.

### Daily Report Input Module
 
As part of the project, I designed a user-friendly interface that allowed end users to easily input daily report data. Without user support
and input, the app would not be effective, would not meet organizational goals, and would not yield any data to analyze.

This module consisted of several parts:
- Upcoming schedule activities scrolldown section
- Table to input crew numbers, hours worked, and task ID of the work performed

My work on this module consisted of optimizing a wire frame of the input table. I collaborated with our pilot project team and contractors to monitor how well previous versions of the software were received. After gathering user input, I came up with new layouts and input methods to help ensure quick adoption of this app. These layouts were relayed to our software developer during weekly meetings, and timelines for mockups and final implementation were determined.

### Daily Report Review Detail Module

Once a successful data entry system was created, I helped create and modify a report approval
module to clean the subcontractor-input data. The module allowed project staff to view submitted
data, edit as needed to ensure accuracy, and approve the final report submissions. Without this
feature, inaccurate data could be used in final analytics and skew manpower metrics.

I helped design the structure of this module. To the team, it appeared as a table. A list of subcontractors that were supposed to be on site appeared in the far left column, and a summary of workers on site, hours worked, and daily report status were displayed.

This module allowed our project field team to quickly assess the manpower on site, and know which contractors they had to follow up with to complete their reports. Ensuring that all subcontractors filled out daily reports was critical to project reporting. Typical projects had less than 10% compliance, but our pilot project indicated a near 100% completion rate which indicated that our team's re-design appeared to improve compliance by a significant amount.

### Daily Report Review Summary Module


, I helped develop analytical tables for our project staff. The key table I
developed displayed approval status and summary manpower values. A mockup of this table is
shown below. Each column represents a date, and each row represents the manpower of a given
subcontractor per day. If a subcontractor submits a report, that day’s cell turns green for that
contractor. If a subcontractor is supposed to be working but did not submit a report their cell will
appear red. A cell appears white if no workers are needed that day.
The table allows project managers to view manpower trends on a project for any date range at a
glance, a feature not available on previously used software. With these trends, project managers
can now more easily do the following:

1. Determine which subcontractors are scheduled to be on site, and why scheduled
contractors are not on site. This helps managers determine whether a project is on-time,
and create mitigation plans as needed to recover any lost time.
2. Contact subcontractors to inquire about insufficient manpower. Having a concise table of
manpower allows project managers to quickly determine whether any subcontractors
have critically low manpower that could slow down progress.
3. Estimate total hours worked on the project for safety record reporting. Prior to the
creation of this table, managers could spend hours or days performing similar estimates
and paperwork for official, mandated records.
4. Determine which daily reports are not approved, and ensure reports subsequently get
approved. Without approval, executive leadership can’t be sure of the report’s accuracy.

## SQL KPI Development

After creating the reporting table above, the team also wanted to create performance measures
for the application to track how project teams were using the app. This would allow executive
leadership to determine whether the app was successful as a whole and monitor individual
project performance. I developed 5 metrics as part of this process. These metrics were as
follows:
1. Accuracy - measures whether subcontractors are submitting accurate reports, judged by
determining whether Clark personnel have edited any of the information submitted by
subs. This is critical because if Clark has to edit many entries, then we are not saving as
much time as anticipated by using the new system.
2. Compliance - measures the number of subcontractors that are submitting reports, as a
percentage of subs that are expected to be working. This is critical because if subs are not
using the new app, then the time spent developing it may have been wasted and it may
not be worth Clark's time and money to maintain and continue to build out the new app.
3. Timeliness - measures the percentage of subcontractors that submit a daily report within
48 hours of the day activities took place. As time goes on, subs are more likely to forget
the details of what happened on previous days and having this statistic can help teams
ensure reports are submitted on time and are hopefully more comprehensive as a result.
4. Timely Compliance - measure combines #2 and #3. This helps teams determine the
number of subs submitting on time as a percentage of how many total reports they are
expecting. This is a more complete measure of compliance.
5. Validation - measures the percent of reports the Clark team has approved. If reports are
not approved, they also have likely not been reviewed by Clark. This is critical because if
Clark is not validating daily submissions, then inaccurate or incomplete daily reports may
not be check.
