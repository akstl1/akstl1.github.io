## Project Description

Duration: September 2021 - Present

### General Role

Commodore Builders recently began transitioning to a more data-driven approach to project management. I have taken the initiative to learn Power BI and assist the internal operations team with creating dashboards and KPIs. These visualizations assist in processes including project-level safety/quality reviews, client-requested COVID compliance tracking, and senior executive KPI progress tracking.

## Projects

### Individual Checklist Data Aggregation

#### Vaccination, sub kickoffs, qaqc manager score

This project was initiated by client request. The client in question requested that all construction workers on their site be vaccinated. If this requirement wasn't met, it could lead to damaged relationships and even project delays. Commodore had no way of tracking this at the time, leading to development of a COVID-19 form in our PMIS that got uploaded into a database.

#### Project Task

Once the vaccination form was created, the team needed a way to quickly view the data each day to verify workers were vaccinated. In its initial state the data from each inspection spanned 10 rows, one row for each question that was asked.

INSERT SAMPLE TABLE HERE

The goal was to aggregate the data so that it was formatted as such:

INSERT SAMPLE TABLE HERE

To do this, I:
- pivoted the table so that questions could be displayed as columns rather than row inputs
- grouped the data so that one inspection spanned one row
- used Combine features in the group by column so that null values were ignored and the data was properly aggregated

#### End Result

---

### Subcontractor Evaluation Dashboard

#### toolbox talk, observation responsiveness, observation #/type, SPA completed overall and weekly, PPE scores


---
### KPIs

#### Project Fee Tracking, Projects ahead of schedule (and %; by finish variance on status), total mitigation (change in finish variance after schedulle update)

---

### Quality and Safety Review Metrics

---

### OSHA Incident Rate Tracking

---

### Project Level Data Aggregation

#### QA/QC kickoffs, Safety and Risk Meetings, weekly apm/super/safety manager inspections

---

### Project team safety insepctions

#### inspections by week, by team member, weekly SPA fix, toolbox talks
