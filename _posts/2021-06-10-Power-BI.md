## Project Description

Duration: September 2021 - Present

### General Role

In recent years, construction company's have been able to utilize newer construction management software's to improve data collection from project sites. Now, these firms are discovering the way's this data can be meaningfully transformed and visualized to create KPIs and dashbaords for executive leaders and project teams alike.

In recent months, I have been assisting Commodore's internal team in developing several Power BI dashboards and measures that were requested by leadership and clients.

## Projects

### Vaccination Status Dashboard

#### Project Initiation

This project was initiated by client request. The client in question requested that all construction workers on their site be vaccinated. If this requirement wasn't met, it could lead to damaged relationships and even project delays. Commodore had no way of tracking this at the time, leading to development of a COVID-19 form in our PMIS that got uploaded into a database.

#### Project Task

Once the vaccination form was created, the team needed a way to quickly view the data each day to verify workers were vaccinated. In its initial state the data from each inspection spanned 10 rows, one row for each question that was asked.

INSERT SAMPLE TABLE HERE

The goal was to aggregate the data so that it was formatted as such:

INSERT SAMPLE TABLE HERE

To do this, I:
- pivoted the table so that questions could be displayed as columns rather than row inputs
- grouped the data so that one inspection spanned one row
- used Combine features in the group by column so that null values were ignored and the data was properly aggregated
