# Description

Commodore Builders recently began transitioning to a more data-driven approach to project management. I have taken the initiative to learn Power BI and assist the internal operations team with creating dashboards and KPIs. These visualizations assist in processes including project-level safety/quality reviews, client-requested COVID compliance tracking, and senior executive KPI progress tracking.

## Individual Checklist Data Aggregation

As part of our QA/QC and safety programs, employees used Procore to fill out different inspections via Procore software. Each inspection included a variety of questions that the team would need to fill out to track things like project progress, subcontractor onboarding, safety/quality status.

After gaining access to this data via connection to Power BI, the company wanted to extract information from these inspections to proactively track project status and goals. Senior leadership would use this data to improve project compliance and performance.

A key way to enable this type of tracking was to view the data from each inspection efficiently. An obstacle to doing so was the initial data structure for each inspection. The team wanted to view each inspection as one row, but in raw form each individual question was listed as its own record. For example, if an inspection had four questions, the corresponding data table would look similar to the below:

|ChecklistID|ProjectID|Position|Question|Response|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|100|1|First_Name|Allan|
|1|100|2|Last_Name|Khariton|
|1|100|3|Role|APM|
|1|100|4|Company|Commodore|

With the above structure, it would not be possible to clearly view the results from numerous inspections quickly. I was tasked with determining whether or not each inspection could be collapsed into one row for efficient viewing and aggregation purposes.

When investigating Power BI's native capabilities, I could not find a function or built-in method to perform this type of aggregation/filtering, and a consultant similarly could not find an "easy" solution for this problem.

Upon further investigation, I found a solution via the Power BI community forums <a href="https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/How-to-group-and-pivot-records-exclude-nulls/m-p/710301">here<a/>.
After reading this solution, I sorted through the posted code and extracted the portion I needed. To solve the problem, I then:
- Duplicated the original table
- Filtered columns out of the duplicate table to include only relevant columns
- Pivoted the table, so that the Question was the pivoted column and the response column was the response field for the pivot

This yielded a table that looked like the below:

|ChecklistID|ProjectID|First_Name|Last_Name|Role|Company|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|100|Allan|...|...|...|
|1|100|...|Khariton|...|...|
|1|100|...|...|APM|...|
|1|100|...|...|...|Commodore|

Now my data was in the same position as the code in the community response, so I utilized the custom groupby syntax to collapse the above data into one row. For the sample data above, the query would look like the below and yield the following table:

<!-- :Query
Grouped Rows = Table.Group(#"Old Table", {"ChecklistID"}, 
    {{"ProjectID", each List.First(List.RemoveNulls([ProjectID]))},{"First_Name", each List.First(List.RemoveNulls([First_Name]))},{"Last_Name", each List.First(List.RemoveNulls([Last_Name]))},{"Role", each List.First(List.RemoveNulls([Role]))},{"Company", each List.First(List.RemoveNulls([Company]))}})
 -->
  
|ChecklistID|ProjectID|First_Name|Last_Name|Role|Company|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|100|Allan|Khariton|APM|Commodore|

With this data structure, the team could now view individual checklist records efficiently and better create measures and KPIs based on responses to checklist questions.
  
### Vaccination

### sub kickoffs

### QAQC manager score

This project was initiated by client request. The client in question requested that all construction workers on their site be vaccinated. If this requirement wasn't met, it could lead to damaged relationships and even project delays. Commodore had no way of tracking this at the time, leading to development of a COVID-19 form in our PMIS that got uploaded into a database.

#### Project Task

Once the vaccination form was created, the team needed a way to quickly view the data each day to verify workers were vaccinated. In its initial state the data from each inspection spanned 10 rows, one row for each question that was asked.

INSERT SAMPLE TABLE HERE

The goal was to aggregate the data so that it was formatted as such:

INSERT SAMPLE TABLE HERE

To do this, I:
- pivoted the table so that questions could be displayed as columns rather than row inputs
- grouped the data so that one inspection spanned one row
- used Combine features in the group by column so that null values were ignored and the data was properly aggregated

#### End Result

---

### Subcontractor Evaluation Dashboard

#### toolbox talk, observation responsiveness, observation #/type, SPA completed overall and weekly, PPE scores


---
### KPIs

#### Project Fee Tracking, Projects ahead of schedule (and %; by finish variance on status), total mitigation (change in finish variance after schedulle update)

---

### Quality and Safety Review Metrics

---

### OSHA Incident Rate Tracking

---

### Project Level Data Aggregation

#### QA/QC kickoffs, Safety and Risk Meetings, weekly apm/super/safety manager inspections

---

### Project team safety insepctions

#### inspections by week, by team member, weekly SPA fix, toolbox talks
