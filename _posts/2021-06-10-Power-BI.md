# Description

Commodore Builders recently began transitioning to a data-driven approach to project management. I have taken the initiative to learn Power BI and assist the director of internal operations with creating dashboards and KPIs for the company's senior leaders. These visualizations will help our leadership and management teams measure progress on project-level safety/quality reviews, client-requested COVID compliance tracking, and organizational KPIs.

## Individual Checklist Data Aggregation

As part of our QA/QC and safety programs, employees use Procore software to fill out different inspections (questionnaires/checklists) via Procore software. Each inspection includes a variety of questions to track project progress, subcontractor onboarding, safety/quality standards, etc..

After gaining access to this data via integration with Power BI, Commodore wanted to extract information from these inspections to proactively track project status and goals. Senior leadership would use this data to improve project compliance and performance.

A key way to enable progress tracking was to view the data from each inspection efficiently. An obstacle to doing so was the inspection table data structure. The team wanted to view each inspection as one row, but in the table each individual question was listed as its own record. For example, if an inspection had four questions, the corresponding data table would look similar to the below example, which includes two inspections:

|ChecklistID|ProjectID|Position|Question|Response|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|100|1|First_Name|Allan|
|1|100|2|Last_Name|Khariton|
|1|100|3|Role|APM|
|1|100|4|Company|Commodore|
|2|300|1|First_Name|Jane|
|2|300|2|Last_Name|Doe|
|2|300|3|Role|SPM|
|2|300|4|Company|Commodore|

With the above structure, it would not be possible to view or analyze the full detail of an inspection quickly. I was tasked with determining whether or not each inspection could be collapsed into one row for efficient viewing and aggregation purposes.

When investigating Power BI's native capabilities, I could not find a function or built-in method to perform this type of aggregation/filtering.

<!-- Upon further investigation, I found a solution via the Power BI community forums <a href="https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/How-to-group-and-pivot-records-exclude-nulls/m-p/710301">here<a/>. -->

After reading this solution, I sorted through the code and extracted the portion I needed. To solve the problem, I:
- Duplicated the original table
- Filtered columns out of the duplicate table
- Pivoted the table by the Question column, with the response column as the value field

This yielded a table that looked like the below:

|ChecklistID|ProjectID|First_Name|Last_Name|Role|Company|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|100|Allan|...|...|...|
|1|100|...|Khariton|...|...|
|1|100|...|...|APM|...|
|1|100|...|...|...|Commodore|
|2|300|Jane|...|...|...|
|2|300|...|Doe|...|...|
|2|300|...|...|SPM|...|
|2|300|...|...|...|Commodore|
    
Now my data was structured properly per the forum solution, so I utilized the advanced groupby syntax to collapse the data into one row. For the sample data above, the query would look like the below and yield the following table:

``` python 

New Table = Table.Group(#"Previous_Table", ("ChecklistID"), 
    (("First_Name", each List.First(List.RemoveNulls([First_Name]))),
    ("Last_Name", each List.First(List.RemoveNulls([Last_Name]))),
    ("Role", each List.First(List.RemoveNulls([Role]))),
    ("Company", each List.First(List.RemoveNulls([Company]))))
```

|ChecklistID|ProjectID|First_Name|Last_Name|Role|Company|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|100|Allan|Khariton|APM|Commodore|
|2|300|Jane|Doe|SPM|Commodore|


With this updated data structure, the team could view checklist records efficiently and create measures/KPIs based on responses.
    
Below are a few examples of how this checklist data aggregation process has been used.
  
### Vaccination Dashboard
  
Several of Commodore's clients required that all workers on site be vaccinated for COVID. To confirm vaccination status, workers on site filled out an inspection verifying their vaccination status.

I used the vaccination questionnaire data to create a searchable table so team members could determine whether a given worker was vaccinated. This led to a 50% reduction in time to check-in and verify status of workers, leading to a more efficient start to the work day for everyone.

### Subcontractor Kickoff Tracking
  
Before a new subcontractor begins work, Commodore requires them to have a kickoff meeting with the project team and fill out a corresponding inspection summary of the meeting. The teams discuss many items including financial logistics, safety plans, scope of work and start date. 

It is critical that these meetings take place at least 2 weeks prior to the subcontractor start date, so everyone has the same expectations for the work to be completed before starting. To this end, I created a dashboard to track:
- The status of all kickoff meetings, including all planned meetings
- Measures showing how many total meetings were done on time, late, or were pending completion
- A % score showing how many meetings have been complete on time

With the above dashboard, our QA/QC team can now track compliance on QA/QC program requirements and inquire more specifically about work to be completed.

## Subcontractor Evaluation Dashboard

The Commodore pre-construction team is incorporating more data into procurement processes. Before analytics data was available, it was difficult to find and evaluate subcontractor performance objectively. With data available, the team now wants to compare contractor safety and performance data apples-to-apples within minutes rather than trying to guess or sort through data from multiple sources for days. This will help the team make informed award decisions based on real-time data, and lead to safer job sites as safety/performance metrics are more integrated during procurement.

To enable this pre-construction goal, I was tasked with created a subcontractor performance dashboard so that key on site measures could be viewed and bidder scores compared.
    
This dashboard had several visuals, including:
- Horizontal bar plot showing the number of toolbox talks done per week. A contractor must perform one per project per week to remind team members about best safety practices.
- Horizontal bar plot showing how quickly a contractor responds to observations. Observations often represent issues, so timely responses and closure of issues can be critical to project QA/QC performance
- Horizontal bar plot categorizing the types of observations assigned to a subcontractor. The team would note how many positive and negative observations a contractor has as an indication of whether work is performed safely and with minimal defect/re-work rate.
- Vertical bar chart showing the number of SPAs done per conractor. SPAs are a summary of a trade's planned work for the day. This document must be filled out daily and is used as a record in case any safety issues arise.
- Horizontal bar plot showing PPE score. Trades must abide by Commodore's PPE policy, and the Commodore team rates contractors weekly on their compliance. Higher scores indicate better compliance to standards, which leads to a safer work place and fewer injuries.

With the above dashboard created, our pre-construction team could now review contractor safety and performance data and incorporate that as part of the

## KPIs

As part of Commodore's shift to data-driven decision making our senior leadership team of ops directors, board members, and C-suite executives, came up with a list of company KPIs that needed to be monitored via Power BI. I worked with our internal operations director to find the relevant datasets, compute KPIs, and put them on a dashboard for viewing by leadership. These KPIs included those listed below.

### Project Fee Tracking

Commodore has a target fee goal for each project, which gets aggregated into an overall company target fee percentage. Creating accurate fee projections is critical to measuring the health and potential of the company. To monitor overall fee, I built a chart that will allow leaders to track how well the company is performing against overall fee goals and drill down into projects that are bringing in less fee than anticipated.
    
To do this I built two measures:

The first measure was the target fee percentage for a project, which is input in a table as a dollar value.

The second measure was the current fee projection for a project. This figure is updated any time a new change order or other contract alteration is entered into our databases. I determined all the relevant entry fields and filters and aggregated them into one measure that could be broken down by project.

I plotted these measures on one line plot over the life of a project. This will allow company leaders to compare target and actual fee, analyze trends, and determine how to best adjust to meet company revenue goals.

### Projects Ahead on Schedule (and %; by finish variance on status)

Construction projects need to finish before a contractual date, or else the general contractor risks absorbing overhead cost and/or liquidated damages levied by the client. As such, company leaders wanted to see a dashboard showing how projects are progressing on their respective target schedules, and an overall percent of projects that are on schedule.

To create this schedule KPI, I used two tables:
- The first was an overall project table, which held basic information about all projects in the company portfolio. 
- The second table contained schedule review data for projects, contained within an inspection table. 
- I left joined these two tables, so that the team could see which projects had inspections conducted. 
- Using this merged table, I calculated the total number of projects ahead of schedule and converted that to a percentage

With this information, leaders can easily see determine which projects are doing well, and which may need additional intervention or funds to get back on target.

### Total Schedule Mitigation (change in finish variance after schedulle update)

Another important schedule-based KPI is schedule mitigation. Schedule mitigation refers to schedule days saved (or lost) by actualizing and optimizing activity sequencing during a schedule review. Using inputs from individual inspections, I aggregated the total schedule mitigation figures into one measure so executives could track how project schedule variances are shifting over time.

### Project Kickoff meetings held on time

Project kickoffs are an important part of the project pre-construction process. Each project team must participate in kickoffs to address the following: Safety, QA/QC, and Risk planning.

To help ensure these meetings occur, I created KPI measures showing the percent of active projects that have held these meetings. I also created a table that would allow managers to efficiently find projects that haven't held these meetings, allowing for quicker scheduling and better compliance.

### Quality and Safety Review Metrics

### OSHA Incident Rate Tracking

A company's OSHA lost time incident rate (LTIR) measures how often serious injuries occur within a company, based on incidents and total hours worked. This rate not only indicates how safe a company tends to be, but is also an important factor in determining insurance rates and even job awards.

I created a measure to track the company LTIR, both presently and over any past timeframe. To do so I pulled data from incident, total internal hours, and total labor hours tables. I applied filters to these data tables to ensure that only the correct time and injury types were recorded, and then used these results to create the OSHA LTIR measure for the company. In addition, I plotted this value by month and quarter so the team could see how our incident rate is changing over time.

This KPI and graphs can now be used to set better company goals and better define a recovery path if the LTIR is trending too high.

## Project Level Data Aggregation

Senior leadership wanted to view what percent of projects perform their mandatory inspections and kickoffs, because compliance in these areas yields better quality, higher safety scores and greater likelihood of making a profit. To meet these demands, I built two dashboards.

### QA/QC Safety and Risk Kickoff Status

To track kickoff meetings, I merged two existing queries:
- A query showing all Commodore projects
- A checklist aggregation showing whether a team has performed each of the required kickoffs, in separate columns

I displayed the above information in a dashboard similar to the below, allowing company leaders to quickly evaluate what projects to target for kickoff meetings in the near future.

### Weekly Inspection Status Tracker

Each project is required to have a weekly safety manager inspection, superintendent inspection, and PM inspection regarding safety and quality on the jobsite.

To track whether inspection frequency goals were being met, I created a table to track the number of weekly inspections of each type were conducted by a project team. I then developed a percent complete score for each project weekly, and rolled this percentage score up into an overall project compliance score.

With this, leaders can now address gaps in inspection protocol so team inspection rates meet the company standard.
